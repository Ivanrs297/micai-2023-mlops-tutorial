# MLOps for Medical Imaging Made Easy üñ•Ô∏è
==============================

This course offers a thorough examination of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) as they relate to computer vision. The course starts with an overview of MLOps and computer vision, then delves deeply into the fundamentals of machine learning and particular computer vision approaches. 

Attendants will get knowledge of the major MLOps platforms and technologies as well as appropriate data management techniques. The model development lifecycle is also covered in the course, with an emphasis on hyperparameter optimization and model validation. By integrating MLOps into computer vision research, researchers can ensure that their models are not only theoretically sound but also practically viable, capable of being deployed and maintained in real-world environments.

A case study on the use of MLOps in medical imaging offers helpful advice. An examination of upcoming MLOps trends and problems brings the course to a close. The course is intended for those interested in the operational elements of machine learning models, particularly in the context of computer vision. It is necessary to have some prior programming expertise, and a fundamental understanding of machine learning techniques.

# Notes

## For DagsHub and DVC
You need to get your `repo-owner`, `repo-name` and `token` from DagsHub.
```bash
dvc remote add -f origin s3://dvc
dvc remote modify origin endpointurl https://dagshub.com/{repo-owner}/{repo-name}.s3
```

**Set DagsHub storage as default DVC remote**
```bash
dvc remote default origin
```

### DVC Credentials
```
dvc remote modify --local origin access_key_id {token}
dvc remote modify --local origin secret_access_key {token}
```
Then you inside `.dvc/config.local` should see your credential

### Push to DVC
Example for `data/raw/iris.csv`

```bash
dvc add data/raw/iris.csv
dvc push -r origin
git add data/raw/iris.csv.dvc .gitignore
git commit -m "Adding example data"
git push
```
